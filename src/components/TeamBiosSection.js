Aware of the climate crisis he made changes to his lifestyle to reduce his carbon footprint, from eating primarily a vegan diet to participating in the zero-waste movement. He soon realized the massive societal need for mainstream solutions to mitigate the climate crisis individuals can take which are both simple and effective. This passion for the environment and desire to be an agent for positive societal change are two of his core values. ",

He is currently a Full-Stack Engineer helping UberEats grow globally, but is driven to use his skillset to help make change. His belief is that the growing success of the tech community can be transitioned into saving the environment and the ability to make a difference needs to be just a click away from the everyday consumer.",
